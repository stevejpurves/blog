## Curvenote is mission driven

Curvenote is a for-profit company with a core mission to promote and develop technologies to support practices of open science. We, Curvenote’s founders, believe that making a lasting, positive impact in science communication and discovery is achieved through a combination of academic institutions, non-profits as well as businesses. Each of these has access to different types of investment, resources, and expertise.

> The rapid progress and infrastructure that open-science requires, will require efforts and input from all of these areas. Open-science and open-source technology cannot be driven by altruism, grants or volunteers alone.

The current business practices of many incumbent publishers are not aligned to the principles of open-science (i.e. pay to publish or pay for access), however, there is ample space for businesses that *do* align to these principles.

Curvenote’s business model **must be aligned to these community goals** - such that if Curvenote does well, the community improves; collaboration improves; reproducibility improves; computational access and literacy improves; and there is more accessible, open, and interactive content in the world. Specifically, this must be aligned to:

1. improving the communication of individual scholarship
2. improving the collaboration between groups of scholars

> It is our goal to support fundamental change in scientific communication that has a measurable impact on human scientific progress within 10 years.

### Our Principles

Curvenote (1) operates with open-core components (e.g. our editor, components, schemas, API; see [curvenote.dev](https://curvenote.dev)); (2) participates in the open-source and open-science ecosystems - improving and contributing to existing projects rather than forking them; and (3) follows and encourages [FAIR data principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data), rather than own or paywall scientific content.

## Current Contributions

We are advocates and participants in open-source ecosystems, communities, and technologies. Our open-source contributions are available at [curvenote.dev](curvenote.dev) and on [github.com/curvenote](github.com/curvenote). [Curvenote.dev](curvenote.dev) is a collection of resources to provide open-source tools that promote and enable interactive scientific writing, reactive documents and explorable explanations. All libraries are released under the **permissive MIT license**, and we encourage community contributions.

### Integrating and building on Jupyter & JupyterBook

Curvenote integrates heavily with Jupyter and builds on its data-structures, interfaces, and protocols. We are committed to integrating, interoperating, and building *with* this open-source community. Our current efforts are focused on integrating with [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/), a static website generator built out of Jupyter and the Sphinx documentation ecosystem. We are helping to build open-infrastructure in [parsers/schemas](https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-myst) and components that improve the editing and interactivity experience in JupyterBook, Jupyter as well as in Curvenote.

Version control, diffing, sharing & re-using content, and portability were all [identified as major pain points by the Jupyter community in their 2020 survey](https://layne-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/all_responses.html). One approach, that many companies take, is to develop proprietary notebook *clones* with this functionality; these often do not directly contribute back to nor improve existing open-source projects. Instead, our approach is to extend functionality, release open-source libraries and components where appropriate (e.g. [commenting components](https://curvenote.dev/sidenotes)) as well as listen, engage in conversation, and develop relationships with contributors in the ecosystem.

## Access, Export, Data, and Privacy Policies

Our data and security policies are listed on our website (under [Data and Security](https://curvenote.com/@curvenote/getting-started/data-and-security)), we will continue to be transparent here, please always let us know if you have any other questions. Additionally, there are more detailed privacy and terms & conditions documents available on [our website](https://curvenote.com/legal/). Our own principles, and [FAIR data principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) more generally, require us to export and give access to your content in useful formats.

> We do not own your content, and will always allow you to export your data and documents in full and useful formats.

Our API documentation is available on [our website](https://curvenote.com/api/), and all content that we bring into Curvenote will have a public-facing, programmatic API that is useful for scientific data management and stewardship.

## Curvenote, now & future

In August 2020, Curvenote (then called iooxa) was a bootstrapped Company built by [Rowan](/@rowanc1), and fuelled by his and [Lindsey](/@lheagy)’s determination to do science collaboration differently.

After [Steve](/@stevejpurves) joined in July 2020, we applied and were accepted into the YCombinator W21 Batch. We choose and work with partners and investors who support our shared open-science mission as well as encourage or adopt our principles of open-components, open-source participation, and FAIR data access.

YCombinator provides initial investment, a startup community, a period of focussed growth, (less sleep), and an excellent opportunity to raise further investment and reach a scale where we can help to make an outsized impact on science communication.

Our mission is to modernize how researchers collaborate and share their work — to accelerate discovery by enabling connections.
