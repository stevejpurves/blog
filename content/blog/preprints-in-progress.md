Publication and dissemination of preprints have a significant positive impact on the acceleration of scientific research and progress in a number of fields. One of the most active and oldest preprint services [arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org) has consistently shown significant year-on-year growth in submissions of preprints {cite:p}`noauthor_arxiv_nodate` with some fields growing exponentially. Publication of a preprint on arXiv covers fields including computer science, machine learning, maths, quantitative finance, physics, and more which perhaps shows that these fields are further ahead in publishing results early.

However, during the COVID pandemic, the biological sciences saw a significant increase in early publication of results, increased collaboration in the scientific community, and the start of perhaps some longer-term changes which this field is still very actively pursued and promoted. The prominent biology preprint service, [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) has seen similar growth in submissions since its inception {cite:t}`Abdill2019Tracking`.

Beyond traditional submission of papers to a preprint service, one organization, {cite:t}`noauthor_preprints_nodate` a scientist-driven non-profit that is visibly promoting not just early sharing of results in biological sciences, but in opening up much of the scientific process around the dissemination of new knowledge as it heads towards a traditional publication.

## preprints in progress

Are preprints, as they are today, themselves intended to be work-in-progress? or are they more understood as a mechanism where a final draft of a paper can be shared whilst the length review process of a journal submission process to complete? Probably while there is a mix of both mindsets, with some researchers actively looking to solicit and act on feedback, and others intending to simply move on whilst the publication process takes its course - I’d bet on the latter being predominant.

The value of preprints to science and the potential to accelerate progress in any field increases the more we can work towards early communication and dissemination of results. Preprints in progress is an excellent term that both embodies this principle and encourages researchers to share findings early — encouraging publication of information that may not be intended for journal publication at all, such as negative results, early exploratory work, confirmatory results, replications or re-analyses {cite:p}`noauthor_preprints_nodate`.

## preprints in progress in your field?

After having read about preprints in progress, and the work of ASAPbio in promoting a shift in scientific communication in biology and medicine, I looked around for other examples of this. Perhaps in other fields that are pushing to progress science more rapidly, such as climate and earth sciences, there are similar movements, perhaps in the computational sciences.

Unfortunately, I’ve yet to find the term or a similar term in use in other fields nor have I found an organization similar to ASAPbio that is currently promoting early communication of work that is not necessarily directly connected to a final publication, as a common practice in science.

## self-publishing a preprint

Preprints tend to be published as PDFs posted on known/recognized preprint services.

Using a preprint service is advantageous today as it provides a good level of distribution for a piece of work, and is a centralized way for others to discover the work, while also meeting the requirements on “dual publication” enforced by some journals and publishers, relieving any worry a researcher may have that publishing a preprint puts a future journal publication at risk.

Yet because of the limited capabilities of many preprint services, this limits the early sharing of information to the information that can fit into a PDF. This is also a significant drawback of the scientific paper, yet it is perhaps even more of a drawback in early work where we want to encourage engagement with the work in order to increase the chances of receiving meaningful feedback.

Or in the case of communicating negative findings, replication, or confirmation studies that will not be put forward for journal publication anyways, the PDF does not provide the richest route for sharing that knowledge.

What if instead, we enabled researchers to self-publish findings, discussions, and articles more frequently using the internet itself?

By allowing researchers to easily publish scientific articles online, on domains that they own, control, or are members of communication could be much more frequent, attribution and licensing clear and by providing DOIs and archiving over such web-based publications, they could be readily references in future

As I talk to more and more researchers about publishing like this, we find that there are two camps. People who are doing this already are looking for ways to improve their workflows and lighten the burden of communicating often and others who are wary of taking such a step and of how it may affect their research rating, or beaten to a publication in a highly competitive research environment.

I’m excited to be working on tools that can make that communication easy for researchers but am also keen to learn the extent of changes needed in different fields to make it possible for more scientists to change to sharing their findings openly and early. In the biological sciences, {cite:t}`noauthor_preprints_nodate` is paving the way and perhaps we need to let this organization and the fields it is working in, define the new standard and demonstrate its benefits.
