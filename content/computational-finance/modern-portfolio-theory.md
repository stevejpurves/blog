## Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

Modern [portfolio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp) theory (MPT) is a theory on how risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to maximize [expected return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp) based on a given level of market risk. [Harry Markowitz](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/harrymarkowitz.asp) pioneered this theory in his paper "Portfolio Selection," which was published in the Journal of Finance in 1952.1 He was later awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on modern portfolio theory.

## Efficient Frontier

In this example, we have a customer report on how well they and balance their Unicorn Porfolio ðŸ¦„ to minimize their risks and see how possible portfolio choices compare to the individual stock positions. By doing this we can achieve a better return with lower risk that any individual stock.\
\
This is done using the Efficient Frontier methodology.

There are 3 articles/notebooks here:

- The final output is a [customer report](https://curvenote.com/oxa:dvunfvCkr67W5YDXfxGE/s4nc69jx3zJKo4LQz3Tk) with a recommendation and interactive chart
- An [internal report](https://curvenote.com/oxa:dvunfvCkr67W5YDXfxGE/0SzCqAXxMjoJgn1i4HUK) from our team that was reviewed before preparing our customer recommendation
- A copy of [the notebook](https://curvenote.com/oxa:dvunfvCkr67W5YDXfxGE/ztSGrPdIpp9w4bJ0m2Vg) used to develop the workflow with supporting analysis and theory

This work is based on the notes of [Ricky Kim](https://github.com/tthustla) which I continue to extend.
